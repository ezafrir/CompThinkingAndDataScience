**Problem 3**

You are given a list of unique positive integers L sorted in descending order and a positive integer sum s. The list has n elements. Consider writing a program that finds values for multipliers  such that the following equation holds: 
Assume a greedy approach to this problem. You calculate the integer multipliers m_0, m_1, ..., m_(n-1) by finding the largest multiplier possible for the largest value in the list, then for the second largest, and so on. Write a function that returns the sum of the multipliers using this greedy approach. If the greedy approach does not yield a set of multipliers such that the equation above sums to s, return the string "no solution".
