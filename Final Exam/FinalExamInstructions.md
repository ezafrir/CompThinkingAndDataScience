**Problem 3**

You have a bucket with 4 red balls and 4 green balls. You draw 3 balls out of the bucket. Assume that once you draw a ball out of the bucket, you don't replace it. You draw 3 balls.
Write a Monte Carlo simulation that meets the specifications below. Feel free to write a helper function if you wish.
def drawing_without_replacement_sim(numTrials):
    '''
    Runs numTrials trials of a Monte Carlo simulation
    of drawing 3 balls out of a bucket containing
    4 red and 4 green balls. Balls are not replaced once
    drawn. Returns a float - the fraction of times 3 
    balls of the same color were drawn in the first 3 draws.
    '''

**Problem 4-1**

You are given the following function and class and function specifications for the two coding problems on this page (also available in this file, die.py):

die.py:
import random, pylab

# You are given this function
def getMeanAndStd(X):
    mean = sum(X)/float(len(X))
    tot = 0.0
    for x in X:
        tot += (x - mean)**2
    std = (tot/len(X))**0.5
    return mean, std

# You are given this class
class Die(object):
    def __init__(self, valList):
        """ valList is not empty """
        self.possibleVals = valList[:]
    def roll(self):
        return random.choice(self.possibleVals)

Write a function called makeHistogram(values, numBins, xLabel, yLabel, title=None), with the following specification:

def makeHistogram(values, numBins, xLabel, yLabel, title=None):

    """

**Problem 6**

Write a function that meets the specifications below. You do not have to use dynamic programming.

Hint: You might want to use bin() on an int to get a string, get rid of the first two characters, add leading 0's as needed, and then convert it to a numpy array of ints. Type help(bin) in the console.

For example,

If choices = [1,2,2,3] and total = 4 you should return either [0 1 1 0] or [1 0 0 1]
If choices = [1,1,3,5,3] and total = 5 you should return [0 0 0 1 0]
If choices = [1,1,1,9] and total = 4 you should return [1 1 1 0]
More specifically, write a function that meets the specifications below:

def find_combination(choices, total):
    """
    choices: a non-empty list of ints
    total: a positive int
    Returns result, a numpy.array of length len(choices) 
    such that
        * each element of result is 0 or 1
        * sum(result*choices) == total
        * sum(result) is as small as possible
    In case of ties, returns any result that works.
    If there is no result that gives the exact total, 
    pick the one that gives sum(result*choices) closest 
    to total without going over.
    """
